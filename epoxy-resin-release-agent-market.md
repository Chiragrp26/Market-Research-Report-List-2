<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epoxy Resin Release Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resin Mold Release Wax</li><li>Resin Mold Release Spray</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Epoxy Resin Release Agent market includes two main types: Resin Mold Release Wax and Resin Mold Release Spray. Resin Mold Release Wax is a solid lubricant applied to the mold surface to prevent the epoxy resin from sticking. It provides a smooth and easy release of the cured resin. On the other hand, Resin Mold Release Spray is a liquid solution that is sprayed onto the mold surface. It forms a thin and uniform layer, ensuring a clean separation of the epoxy resin from the mold. Both types play a crucial role in facilitating the release process in epoxy resin applications.</p></p>
