<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nuclear Fuel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uranium-235</li><li>Plutonium-239</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The nuclear fuel market can be classified into different types based on the type of fuels used. Uranium-235 is one commonly used fuel, which undergoes fission in nuclear reactors to release energy. Plutonium-239 is another fuel type that is produced through the irradiation of uranium-238. It can be used in nuclear reactors as a substitute for uranium fuel. Additionally, there are various other types of nuclear fuels, such as thorium and plutonium-241, which also have their own unique properties and applications in the nuclear industry.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Nuclear Fuel Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Boiling-water Nuclear Reactors</li><li>Pressurized-water Nuclear Reactors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The nuclear fuel market finds application in two types of nuclear reactors: boiling-water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized-water reactors (PWRs). BWRs utilize a single-loop system where water boils directly in the reactor core, producing steam that drives a turbine. PWRs, on the other hand, operate with a two-loop system, where water is kept under high pressure to prevent it from boiling. In both cases, nuclear fuel, typically uranium or plutonium, undergoes a controlled fission process to generate heat, which is then converted into electricity.</p></p>
