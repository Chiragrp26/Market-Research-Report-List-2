<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dried Vegetables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Freeze Dried Vegetables</li><li>Air Dried Vegetables</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The dried vegetables market consists of two main types: freeze-dried vegetables and air-dried vegetables. Freeze dried vegetables are made by freezing the vegetables and removing the water content through sublimation, resulting in a lightweight and crunchy texture that retains most of the original flavor and nutritional value. On the other hand, air-dried vegetables are dehydrated by exposing them to warm air, which slowly evaporates the water, preserving the vegetables while reducing their weight and volume. Both types of dried vegetables are popular for their long shelf life, convenience, and versatility in cooking.</p></p>
