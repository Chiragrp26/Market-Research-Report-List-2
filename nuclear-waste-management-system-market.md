<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nuclear Waste Management System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Level Waste</li><li>Intermediate Level Waste</li><li>High Level Waste</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Nuclear Waste Management System Market comprises of three main types of waste: Low Level Waste (LLW), Intermediate Level Waste (ILW), and High Level Waste (HLW). LLW refers to materials with low radioactivity levels that can be disposed of in engineered landfills. ILW has a higher radioactivity level and is typically immobilized or encapsulated before being stored or disposed of in specially designed facilities. HLW is the most radioactive and requires advanced treatment techniques, such as deep geological repositories, for long-term storage or disposal.</p></p>
