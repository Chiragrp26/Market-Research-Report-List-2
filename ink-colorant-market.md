<p><ul><li>Dye</li><li>Pigment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ink colorants can be divided into two main types: dye and pigment. Dye colorants are soluble substances that are able to permeate through the liquid or solid material they are applied to, resulting in vibrant and transparent colors. Pigment colorants, on the other hand, are insoluble particles that are dispersed in the ink or coating, providing more opaque and intense shades. While dyes are known for their excellent color strength and brilliance, pigments offer better lightfastness and resistance to fading.</p></p>
