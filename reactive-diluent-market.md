<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reactive Diluent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aliphatic</li><li>Aromatic</li><li>Cycloaliphatic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Reactive diluents are additives used in the formulation of coatings, adhesives, and sealants to modify their properties and reduce viscosity. They can be categorized into three types: aliphatic, aromatic, and cycloaliphatic based on their chemical structure. Aliphatic diluents are made of straight-chain hydrocarbons, offering good outdoor durability and UV resistance. Aromatic diluents are composed of benzene rings, providing excellent solvency but limited UV resistance. Cycloaliphatic diluents combine characteristics of aliphatic and aromatic types, offering improved chemical resistance and UV stability. The choice of reactive diluent depends on the desired properties of the end product.</p></p>
