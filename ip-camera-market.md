<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IP Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized IP Camera</li><li>Decentralized IP Camera</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The IP camera market has two main types: Centralized IP Camera and Decentralized IP Camera. Centralized IP Cameras are connected to a network video recorder (NVR), which is responsible for processing and storing video footage. They require an additional device and can be harder to install, but they offer more advanced features and centralized control. On the other hand, Decentralized IP Cameras have built-in recording functionality, eliminating the need for an NVR. They are easier to install and offer greater flexibility, but may lack some advanced features of centralized cameras.</p></p>
